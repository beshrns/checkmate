This repo was created to host my patch to checkmate to make it work with Matlab 2014b.

CheckMate is a MATLABÂ®-based tool for modeling, simulating, and verifying properties of hybrid dynamic systems. These are dynamic systems with both discrete and continuous state variables. Hybrid systems often arise in computer-controlled systems where the discrete dynamics corresponds to logic for switching control modes and the continuous dynamics corresponds to the physical system being controlled.
